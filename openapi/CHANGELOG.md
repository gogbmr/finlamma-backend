# API Changelog

Plain-English record of what changed in `openapi/openapi.json`, published via `/publish-contract`.

## 2026-09-22 — v0.1.0 (initial publish)

First formal publish of the contract — no prior version was ever published through this process,
so this establishes the `0.1.0` baseline rather than describing a bump. Covers everything built
through Phase 1, Phase 2a (onboarding, parental consent, legal documents) and Phase 2b (learning
content: mentors, worlds, lessons, quizzes).

**Identity, account & onboarding**
- `GET /api/v1/me`, `PATCH /api/v1/me`, `DELETE /api/v1/me` — profile, update, account deletion.
- `PATCH /api/v1/me/date-of-birth` — set-once, determines under-18 status.
- `PATCH /api/v1/me/onboarding-complete` — marks the first-open mentor-intro modal as seen.

**Legal documents & parental consent**
- `GET /api/v1/legal/{type}` — published Terms/Privacy/Risk-disclosure text.
- `GET /api/v1/me/legal-status` — this user's acceptance status per document.
- `POST /api/v1/me/legal/accept` — record self-acceptance.
- `POST /api/v1/me/legal/reapproval/resend` — resend a parent re-approval link after a legal
  document changes.
- `POST /api/v1/me/parent-consent/request` — start the parental consent flow for a minor.

**Learning content**
- `GET /api/v1/mentors`, `GET /api/v1/mentors/{key}` — published Lamma mentors.
- `GET /api/v1/worlds` — published worlds, ordered, with this user's own sequential unlock state.
- `GET /api/v1/worlds/{id}/lessons` — a world's lesson list.
- `GET /api/v1/lessons/{id}` — lesson detail.
- `GET /api/v1/me/current-lesson` — resume-banner pointer to the learner's in-progress lesson.
- `POST /api/v1/lessons/{id}/steps/{n}/serve` — serve the next quiz step (server-stamped timer
  start).
- `POST /api/v1/lessons/{id}/steps/{n}/answer` — submit and server-grade an answer (server-timed,
  idempotent, no answer/explanation leak before grading).

**System**
- `GET /api/v1/health` — service health, migration drift, legal-document and content-completeness
  warnings.
- `POST /api/webhooks/clerk`, `POST /api/webhooks/clerk-staff` — Clerk identity sync (consumer and
  staff apps), signature-verified.

Not yet in the contract: worlds/mentors/lessons/questions admin CRUD (Server Actions, not REST
per `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` D16, so intentionally outside this contract) and everything in
`docs/ROADMAP.md` Phase 3 onward (XP/V Money, trading, Arena, news).
